##### We can access data of a particular column from a csv file using following code:
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
saved_column = df.column_name #you can also use df['column_name']


age,gender,economic_status will serve in determining a perfect product for this category based on products sorted
on the basis of weather, locality, calendar and relations.
--> when an special day comes for any of the family member a list of suggested products from our side will be generated
-> based on the factors like locality, weather_in_the_locality, calender_events_nearby and out of these product list,
-> a perfect product will be chosen based on the sorting factors like age,gender,economic_status,wish_list

file2.csv
search_keywords, recently_purchased_product, wish-list, cart

all these will serve in calculating directly the intent of a user and then suggesting products relevant to these factors
only.

WHEN ARE WE PLANNING TO GENERATE NOTIFICATIONS:
----->locality and weather_in_the_locality will not have their separate notifications rather they will be considered
----->for selecting a perfect product for the following notifications.

--> Special days of the user/ family member.(like birthday)
--> User activity notifications.(Like add_to_cart_notification, transaction_alert,order_status)
--> Suggested products based on wish-list(once a week for each product)(In wish-list we will allow user to turn on/off
notifications for each product by selecting find_better_deals_for_this_product.)
--> Suggested products based on searched_keywords.(no. of notifications depend on
number of each category 'products searched', one notification for each category searched.)[category ex. Mobile_phones,
Storage_devices, Clothes, daily_items]
--> Suggested products based on recently_purchased_product.(One notification for each product purchased.)
--> Suggested product based on upcoming_calendar_events.(Like festivals)

Check if we can determine the action that a user performs on any of the notifications in android to calculate active
hours.
